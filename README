kuberoute /kjuːb ɹuːt/
======================

Kuberoute is a program that lets you conntect kubernetes services with
domain names.

how it works
------------

kuberoute queries kubernetes for services and pods in fixed intervals.
You can configure which services are queried in the mandatory config
file for kuberoute.

If it finds a service with the kuberoute_domain and the kuberoute_name
labels, it will lookup which pods are served by the service.
kuberoute will try to find the addresses of the nodes the pods are
running on and notify the configure dns service about these pods.

Currently ``route53`` and ``skydns`` are implemented as a valid DNS
service.

Although you can specify more than one namespace in the kuberoute
config file, kuberoute will only search the namespace of the service
when looking for appropriate pods.

configuration
=============

command line arguments
----------------------

kuberoute takes 2 command line arguments:

--port NUMBER
  Specifies on which port to listen on, optional when specified in
  configuration file

--config PATH
  Path to a valid config file.

configuration file
------------------

The confguration file follows the INI format.  A valid config file has
to contain at least a section called ``kuberoute`` and a section that
describes a DNS backend.

Here is an example::

  [kuberoute]
  kubeconfig_kind = serviceaccount
  port = 8081
  dns_backend = skydns
  domain_label = kuberoute_domain
  name_label = kuberoute_name
  failover_label = kuberoute_failover
  quota_label = kuberoute_quota
  namespace = default

  [skydns]
  # host of the etcd instance that skydns uses,
  # this is NOT THE SKYDNS HOST
  host = etcd.server.url
  port = 2379
  protocol = http

  [route53]
  # this section will be ignored.  you could use this
  # backend by activating it in the [kuberoute] section
  aws_access_key_id = 123456ABCDEF
  aws_secret_access_key = abcdefghijk12334677246

Started with the above configuration, kuberoute will query kubernetes
for all services with the labels 'kuberoute_domain' and
'kuberoute_name', lookup the values for those labels and propagate the
public ip addresses of the hosts, running pods for the service, to the
DNS backend, which is skydns in this case.

If you had a service with the following definition::

  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Service
  metadata:
    annotations:
      service.beta.kubernetes.io/external-traffic: OnlyLocal
    name: kuberoute-testservice
    labels:
      kuberoute_domain: schneevonmorgen.com
      kuberoute_name: quatsch
      kuberoute_failover: failover.schneevonmorgen.com
      kuberoute_quota: 80
  spec:
    type: NodePort
    ports:
      - port: 80
        protocol: TCP
    selector:
      app: testapp

kuberoute would do the following:

1. Query all the pods that match the selector ``{ 'app': 'testapp'}``
   and get the ip address of the node they are running on.

2. Get the domain name by reading the value of the
   ``kuberoute_domain`` label, namely ``schneevonmorgen.com``.

3. Get the name of the service by reading the value of the
   ``kuberoute_name`` label, namely ``quatch``.

4. Publish all the target ip adresses found in step 1 to SkyDNS under
   the name ``quatsch.schneevonmorgen.com``.

5. If no pods are found with the above selector or less then 80
   percent of nodes (as defined with the ``kuberoute_quota`` label)
   provide the service, kuberoute propagates
   ``failover.schneevonmorgen.com`` to the DNS server.

authentification
----------------

kuberoute lets you choose the authentification implementation in the
config file.  There are currently 3 authentification systems
implemented.

serviceaccount
  You can use this authentification method if you are running on a
  cluster that provides service accounts.  No further configuration is
  required.::

    [kuberoute]
    kubeconfig_kind = serviceaccount

kubeconfig
  This authentification method implies that there is a valid kube
  config file on the system.  Specify the path to this file in a
  seperate subsection.  Here is an example::

    [kuberoute]
    kubeconfig_kind = kubeconfig
    ...

    [kubeconfig]
    filename = /root/.kube/config

kubernetes_url
  This authentification method can only used with kubernetes clusters
  that don't have authentification enabled.  Specify a url where the
  cluster is located.  Additionally you can specify if you want to
  verify TLS certificates (default: true) and a CA certificate
  (default: None) if necessary.::

    [kuberoute]
    kubeconfig_kind = kubernetes_url
    ...

    [kubernetes_url]
    url = https://127.0.0.1:8080
    verify = true
    certificate_authority = /var/lib/ssl/ca.crt

state report
------------

You can let kuberoute report its state to an AWS S3 bucket.  To enable
state reporting, write something like this into your config file ::

  [s3report]
  # The access key for aws
  aws_access_key_id = abcd
  # The secret access key for aws
  aws_secret_access_key = abcdefg
  # The region your bucket lives in
  region_name = eu-central-1
  # the name of the bucket
  bucket_name = statusreport-bucket
  # The "filename" in the bucket that you want to report to
  key = file/in/bucket
  # The ACL for the report (defaults to private)
  acl = public-read
  # The content type for the report (guesses from key by default)
  content_type = application/json

The output format of the file is json.

building
========

nix
---

There is a ``default.nix`` in the root of this repository.  You can
build kuberoute by simply executing ``nix-build`` in that directory.
This will build kuberoute with a predefined nix package set by
default.  You can override the nixpkgs package set used by passing it
as an argument.  Here is an example::

  nix-build --arg "nixpkgs" "import /src/nixpkgs-master {}"


pip
---

This package uses pythons ``setuptools``.  Simply install all the
requirements via pip or easy_install and then run ``python3 setup.py
install``.

docker image
------------

If you are on GNU/Linux you can build a docker image that runs
kuberoute simply by executing ``make docker_image`` in the root
directory of this repo.

hacking
=======

nix build system
----------------

We use the nix build system to test and package kuberoute.  If you are
on a GNU/Linux operating system and have ``nix`` installed you can
simply call the ``nix-shell`` program in the root directory of this
repo and get a shell environment where all dependencies are installed
and configured.

pip
---

kuberoute is implemented in python3, meaning that you can install all
the development dependencies via ``pip``.  There is a
``requirements.txt`` file in the root directory of this repository and
also a ``nix/requirements_frozen.txt`` which contains the actual
versions used by the default build system.  So if you want a build
environment similar to the one the build system uses, you should
probably create a ``virtualenv`` and ``pip install -r
nix/requirements_frozen.txt`` in that environment.  You'll probably
need ``libxml2`` and ``libxslt`` installed on your system.

testing
-------

We use ``nosetests`` as a test runner.  All tests are located in the
``tests`` directory.  To run the tests the src files should be your
``PYTHONPATH``. ``./run-tests`` does that for you.
